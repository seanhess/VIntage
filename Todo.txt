[√] Deactivate when switching out of app (not the same as switching to a group)
[√] Read all config from a text file
[√] Override config from a file - /Library/Application Support/VIntage
[ ] App-specific settings (to get find to work nicely in each app) 
    [ ] Then: better xcode find
    
[ ] Read Active Applications from a file
[ ] Icon
[ ] Nicer-looking visual indicator

LATER
[ ] Use acessibility to implement fX, better a, etc

BUGS
[ ] Escape should get you out of find mode - requires different settings for different apps! Oh no! - or just an override
[ ] CMD-SHIFT-O should work, and let you type (it should put you into find files mode)
[√] App Switch - Same mode when you come back - it's switching to insert all the time
[√] App Switch - doesn't always show inactive
[√] Visual mode Delete - Delete + Command 
[√] dd, d deletes two lines, should be halfway through second dd
[ ] Entering command mode should close any autocomplete box (issue an escape as well as moving command mode?) -- no (Command .)

RESEARCH
[ ] Magic Mac Keyboard stuff? 
[ ] Can I put borders ALL around the screen (but make them smaller?)

OPTIONS
[ ] Figure out how to do a "Stop All" so that we don't have to specify all the combos
[ ] "." character for simple stuff - just log ALL the keystrokes when in insert mode? No, it's really about what was inserted. 

CRAZY IDEAS
[ ] Overwrite mode? -- doesn't look like it
[ ] Put applications into a simple file, and read that (easy!) -- completely override with their apps? -- use simple names
[ ] Manual Overwrite mode. Manual -- No, it'd kind lame because it moves your cursor to the beginning of the line
[ ] Incremental Search -- no luck
