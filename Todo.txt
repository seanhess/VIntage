[√] Deactivate when switching out of app (not the same as switching to a group)
[ ] Read all config from a text file
    [√] multiple sets
    [ ] Overhaul buffer code
        [ ] if part of a match, store in buffer
        [ ] if exact match, execute, clear buffer
        [ ] if no matches left, clear buffer 
        --- somebody needs a tree :)
        --- not really, just store each step of the process in a dictionary as an array of further possibilities?
        --- "C" -> Continue
        --- "CO" -> Continue
        --- "COP" -> Nothing!
        --- "COW" -> Execute!
[ ] Override config from a file - /Library/Application Support/VIntage
[ ] UI to select applications (menu bar options)
[ ] App-specific settings (to get find to work nicely in each app)
[ ] Icon
[ ] Nicer-looking visual indicator

BUGS
[ ] Escape should get you out of find mode - requires different settings for different apps! Oh no! - or just an override
[ ] CMD-SHIFT-O should work, and let you type (it should put you into find files mode)
[ ] App Switch - Same mode when you come back
[ ] App Switch - doesn't always show inactive
[ ] Visual mode Delete - Delete + Command 
[ ] dd, d deletes two lines, should be halfway through second dd

RESEARCH
[ ] Magic Mac Keyboard stuff? 
[ ] Can I put borders ALL around the screen (but make them smaller?)
