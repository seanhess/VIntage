[√] Deactivate when switching out of app (not the same as switching to a group)
[ ] Read all config from a text file
    [√] multiple sets
    [ ] Inherit    
    [ ] single commands only if not preceeded by another (favor long ones!) - 
        - any time you get an action, clear the buffer
        - otherwise, just save them up until you hit escape
        - no, if you run out of possible combinations, clear the buffer to "DP"
        - show buffer in menu - just like VI:
    [ ] Visual, Insert, and Find
[ ] Override config from a file - /Library/Application Support/VIntage
[ ] UI to select applications (menu bar options)

BUGS
[ ] Escape should get you out of find mode - requires different settings for different apps! Oh no! - or just an override
[ ] CMD-SHIFT-O should work, and let you type (it should put you into find files mode)
[ ] App Switch - Same mode when you come back
[ ] App Switch - doesn't always show inactive
[ ] Visual mode Delete - Delete + Command 
[ ] Visual mode P - Paste + Command mode
[ ] dd, d deletes two lines, should be halfway through second dd

RESEARCH
[ ] Magic Mac Keyboard stuff? 
[ ] Can I put borders ALL around the screen (but make them smaller?)
